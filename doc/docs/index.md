# MPB
---

**MPB** is a free software package for computing the band structures, or dispersion relations, and electromagnetic modes of periodic dielectric structures, on both serial and parallel computers. MPB is an acronym for *MIT Photonic Bands*. MPB computes definite-frequency eigenstates, or harmonic modes, of [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations) in periodic dielectric structures for arbitrary wavevectors, using fully-vectorial and three-dimensional methods. It is applicable to many problems in optics, such as waveguides and resonator systems, and [photonic crystals](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/book). For example, it can solve for the modes of waveguides with arbitrary cross-sections.

See also our complementary [Meep](https://meep.readthedocs.io/) package for time-domain simulations, reflection/transmission spectra, etc.

Features
--------

-   **Free software** under the [GNU GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).
-   Portable to any Unix-like system such as [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS).
-   Support for **parallel** machines with MPI.
-   Fully-vectorial **1d, 2d, 3d** calculations. Iterative eigensolver techniques are employed to make large calculations possible.
-   **Direct, frequency-domain eigensolver** as opposed to indirect methods, e.g. time-domain. This means that you get both eigenvalues (frequencies) and eigenstates (electromagnetic modes) at the same time. See a [comparison of time-domain and frequency-domain techniques](Introduction.md#frequency-domain-vs-time-domain).
-   **Targeted eigensolver**. Normally, iterative eigensolvers provide you with the states (photonic bands/modes) with the lowest few frequencies. MPB can alternatively compute the modes whose frequencies are closest to a specified target frequency. This greatly reduces the number of bands that must be computed in guided or resonant mode calculations.
-   Flexible, scriptable user interface based on [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_programming_language). A [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_programming_language) interface is under development.
-   Support for arbitrary, **anisotropic** dielectricstructures including **gyrotropic/magneto-optic** materials and **non-orthogonal** unit cells.
-   Field output in [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) format supported by many visualization tools.

To give you some feel for how long these calculations take, let us consider one typical data point. For the 3d band-structure of a [diamond lattice of dielectric spheres in air](Data_Analysis_Tutorial.md#diamond-lattice-of-spheres), computing the lowest 10 bands on a 16×16×16 grid at 31 k-points, MPB took 8 seconds on a 2.8 GHz AMD Opteron under Debian with the [ATLAS](http://www.netlib.org/atlas/) optimized BLAS library. Thus, at each k-point, MPB was minimizing a function with 81920 degrees of freedom in 0.26 seconds on average.
